# Challenge 21: Book-Search

In this weeks challenge, starter code was given.  
The challenge:  Given that the Book Search page is fully functional. The "Lead" developer of my company, has tasked me to include certain criteria, in order for even better functionality of the page.
The fully working page should render information, such as the book title, author and description, and page count. And also given the ability to save their favorite books once signed in, for future refrence.
